HistoNet (beta)
===============

An image histogram is a type of histogram that acts as a graphical 
representation of the tonal distribution in a digital image. It plots the number
of pixels for each tonal value. By looking at the histogram for a specific image
a viewer will be able to judge the entire tonal distribution at a glance.

This project aims to create a tool to classify imgaes by analyzing histograms
using a neural network. I took the idea from Green Dam Youth Escort.
Green Dam recognizes pornographic images by analyzing skin-coloured regions,
complemented by human face recognition. However, according to a Southern Weekly
article, the software is incapable of recognizing pictures of nudity featuring
black or red-skinned characters but sensitive enough to images with large
patches of yellow that it censors promotional images of the film Garfield:
A Tail of Two Kitties. Thats why I decided to add the neural network.


This project still very beta! And needs your colaboration!
Thanks!
