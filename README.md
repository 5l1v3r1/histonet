HistoNet (beta)
===============

An image histogram is a type of histogram that acts as a graphical 
representation of the tonal distribution in a digital image. It plots the number
of pixels for each tonal value. By looking at the histogram for a specific image
a viewer will be able to judge the entire tonal distribution at a glance.

This project aims to create a tool to classify imgaes by analyzing histograms
using a neural network. This project still very beta!
